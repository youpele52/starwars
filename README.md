This is a Star Wars app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [The Star Wars`API SWAPI`](https://swapi.dev/).

## Getting Started

First, run the following command to install the libraries and the dependencies used in this app:

```bash

yarn
```

## Start the app

After installing the all the dependencies, start the app by using this command

```bash

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
